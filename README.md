# Ren'py NX Ports
A compilation of Ren'Py homebrew ports for the Nintendo Switch using uyjulian's Ren'Py Switch SDK. Some ports may have bugs that will be listed in each individual game section.

Please note that for all games that cost money, you'll need to provide your own "game" folder from your game of choice in the same folder as the game's .nro file.

## GirlsAreWeirdNX - Girls Are Weird

Unofficial port of the Ren'Py visual novel "Girls Are Weird" by bentosmile.

## DokiDokiNX - Doki Doki Literature Club!

Unofficial port of the Ren'Py visual novel "Doki Doki Literature Club!" by Team Salvato. This is meant to be a fully vanilla port with PC mod support. Keyboard input is currently broken, and save functionality is iffy.

## CenaNX
Unofficial port of the Ren'Py visual novel "John Cena's Sexy High School Adventure!!!" by Lazlo319, using the Ren'Py Switch SDK. Why? Because why not.

## TODO:

- Make save data for each game save either in .nro folder or system data (like an actual Switch game) instead of a folder on the SD card root.
- Convert .rpy and .py files for free games for faster boot times (the end user will have to do it themselves for paid games as I don't want to distribute copyrighted content, support your local game devs!). 
- Fix keyboard input issue with Doki Doki Literature Club & Milk inside a bag of milk inside a bag of milk (fairly sure it's the same problem).

Feel free to make forks and edits of this repository as needed, any and all help to get these games near-100% would be wonderful!
